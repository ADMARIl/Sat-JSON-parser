# Sat-JSON-parser
A C# project to parse the data from a ~~json~~ csv file containg data on many celestial bodies currently orbiting the earth. 

**The decision to switch from a json to a csv data set was made mid-devlopment so naming inconsitencies may occur**

Full project and readme can be found at [super-f6](https://github.com/bwitt19/super-f6)

Finished version releases will be stored in the _Releases_ tab of this repository. Working builds can be found in _master_, alongside other branches with ongoing feature development.
